\begin_layout Title
The Newspaper Swap Event in 2017

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite the extensive attention given to daily newspapers due to their comprehen
sive coverage of national and international news, there exists a significant
 research gap when it comes to community newspapers in Canada.
 There is a severe lack of academic papers discussing community newspapers
 in Canada.
 However, these local publications hold a critical role in delivering informatio
n that is regionally relevant, serving as essential channels for local governmen
t activities, advertisements, and fundraising for local projects or elections.
 Moreover, they possess substantial cultural value as a cherished element
 of Canadian society.
 Furthur, community newspapers face challenges from online news platforms
 with declining profitability, which has led to closures of many newspapers.
 A noteworthy example is the that Postmedia and Toronto Star swapped dozens
 of community newspapers in 2014, with most of the swapped paper were shut
 down as a cost-cutting strategy, leading to reduction of around 244 jobs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The newspaper industry holds a rich heritage and has historically appealed
 to older generations who exhibit a lesser inclination towards seeking news
 online.
 Additionally, community newspapers play a vital role in areas where internet
 accessibility is limited, ensuring that residents have access to news sources
 beyond the online realm.
 Therefore, it is crucial to acquire a comprehensive understanding of the
 newspaper swap events that occurred in 2017, as they have led to the significan
t closure of newspapers, some of which have a rich history spanning several
 decades.
 The closures of newspapers in these affected markets not only result in
 a reduction of local news coverage but are also accompanied by an effort
 by Postmedia and Toronto Star to avoid direct product competition.
 This avoidance is achieved through the swapping of newspapers in several
 markets where both companies operate, ultimately leading to an increased
 concentration of each company's presence within the affected markets.
 Consequently, this consolidation raises pertinent questions regarding the
 impact on circulation and advertising rates in these markets.
 It is particularly important to investigate whether newspapers owned by
 these two companies have seen an increase in advertising rates as a result
 of their increased market power, and whether the consolidation has had
 negative effects on newspapers operated by smaller companies in the affected
 markets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To address these questions, we collected newspaper circulation data from
 News Media Canada and advertising rate data from Adoreach in Ontario, covering
 the period from 2013 to 2019.
 The News Media Canada dataset includes information on circulation areas,
 operating companies, circulations, and distribution days of each newspaper.
 We merged this data with the advertising rate data based on newspaper names.
 Using the circulation area of each newspaper, we determined representative
 latitude and longitude coordinates corresponding to their locations.
 Subsequently, we identified the census subdivisions that encompassed these
 points and defined the census subdivision in which a newspaper circulates
 as its market.
 By analyzing this dataset, we were able to determine the census subdivisions
 affected by the newspaper swap in 2017 and identify the newspapers operating
 within those markets.
 We consider the census subdivision an appropriate market definition for
 community newspapers, as community newspapers primarily provide news relevant
 to the local municipality, including government initiatives, fundraising
 events, and political activities.
 The term "census subdivision" is synonymous with "municipality" and accurately
 reflects the scope of coverage provided by these newspapers.

\begin_layout Section
Data and Summary Statistics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our study focuses on the newspaper editions.
 For instance, if a newspaper circulates twice a week, such as on Tuesday
 and Thursday, it is considered as two separate newspaper editions, each
 with circulation on its respective day.
 This definition aligns with the practices of auditing firms that conduct
 separate circulation audits for each edition.
 Additionally, treating each edition of a newspaper as a separate entity
 enhances comparability in terms of weekly circulations.
 It also accounts for the possibility that each edition may have distinct
 content and framework.
 The dataset used in this study covers the period from 2013 to 2019 and
 includes a total of 595 newspaper editions.
 Out of these, 372 newspaper editions could be matched to obtain an appropriate
 advertising rate.
 The data used in this study is subject to an imbalance resulting from various
 factors, including the closure and opening of newspaper editions, as well
 as the decisions of certain newspapers not to subscribe to the membership
 of News Media Canada during specific years, leading to their exclusion
 from the dataset.
 Despite the dataset is not complete, we leverage the richness and comprehensive
ness of this dataset to gain valuable insights into the event.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During the event, a total of 39 community newspapers were swapped.
 Out of these, 33 newspapers were subsequently closed immediately after
 the swap, resulting in only 6 newspapers continuing their operations under
 new ownership.
 To identify the swapped newspapers, we observed their titles from public
 media sources.
 We then determined the census subdivisions in which these newspapers were
 operating.
 It is worth noting that some newspapers may operate in multiple census
 subdivisions, and we considered all of those census subdivisions as affected
 in our analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In total, we found that 36 census subdivisions were affected by the swap
 events.
 Additionally, our dataset identified 221 census subdivisions as circulation
 areas for some newspapers.
 Among the 39 swapped newspapers, we were able to identify 30 of them in
 our dataset.
 Furthermore, our dataset suggests that there are an additional 34 newspapers
 (excluding the swapped ones) operating under the affected census subdivisions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consistent with the industrial report from News Media Canada, our data suggests
 that the ownership of the newspapers is concentrated among large corporations.
 Among the 372 newspaper editions in our dataset, 223 of them are owned
 by either Metroland or Postmedia, which are the two largest firms in the
 community newspaper industry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regarding the events that occurred, a total of 70 newspaper editions were
 affected in some way (either swapped or operated under the market affected
 by the swap).
 Out of these 70 newspaper editions, 56 of them belong to either Postmedia
 or Metroland, further emphasizing the dominance of these large corporations
 in the affected market.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The majority of newspaper editions are available free of charge, although
 some require payment.
 Moreover, our dataset includes newspaper editions that have both paid and
 free circulation.
 We classify a newspaper edition as "free" if it exclusively had free circulatio
n from 2013 to 2019, "paid" if it solely had paid circulation during that
 period, and "both paid and free" if it had at least one year with positive
 free circulation and at least one year with paid circulation.
 In our analysis, we identified 157 newspaper editions classified as "free,"
 74 editions classified as "paid," and 140 editions with nonzero paid or
 free circulation for at least one year.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 1 presents the mean total circulation, which combines the free circulatio
n and paid circulation for each newspaper edition, across different groups
 over the years.
 Notably, newspaper editions owned by either Postmedia or Metroland exhibit
 a consistently higher average circulation compared to other ownership groups.
 The figure indicates an overall declining trend in mean circulation over
 the years.
 However, the mean circulation of newspaper editions in the affected census
 subdivisions experienced a significant increase after 2017, suggesting
 a possible reduction in competition within those areas.
 It is important to acknowledge the potential presence of survival bias,
 wherein Postmedia and Metroland may have closed newspapers with lower circulati
ons, resulting in an increased mean circulation for the affected census
 subdivisions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 2 displays the mean national line rate for each line of advertisement
 across different groups over the years.
 As expected, newspaper editions owned by Postmedia or Metroland, which
 also exhibit higher average circulations, demonstrate a consistently higher
 rate compared to other newspapers.
 Notably, the mean rate of newspaper editions owned by Postmedia or Metroland
 operating in the affected census subdivisions experienced a significant
 jump after the event in 2017.
 Although there appears to be an increasing trend in the rate across time
 for all newspaper editions, this pronounced jump suggests a potential posibilit
y of reduction in competition within those specific areas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 3 depicts the number of newspaper editions across each year.
 It is crucial to interpret this figure with caution due to potential data
 incompleteness.
 The presence of a newspaper edition in the dataset does not necessarily
 indicate its closure at a later date.
 Nevertheless, the data consistently suggests a decline in the number of
 newspapers over time, aligning with industry discussions on this matter.
 Irrespective of ownership groups, a declining trend is observed in the
 number of newspaper editions.
 The most substantial drop occurs in 2017, and this decline continues from
 2018 to 2019.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Investigation of Survival Bias (Updated: June 18, 2023)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the dataset includes all newspaper editions for each year, and calculates
 the mean circulation and advertising rates annually for each group, it's
 plausible that the observed surge in mean circulation and rates in the
 affected markets is attributable to the predominance of Postmedia and Metroland.
 These media conglomerates, owning most of the newspaper editions, may have
 closed numerous underperforming editions, pushign up the mean statistics
 in the affected market.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Closure of poorly performing newspapers leaves only those with high circulation
 and advertising rates, thereby driving up the mean values in the affected
 markets.
 To further analyze this, we have refined the dataset to include only those
 newspaper editions that were operational before 2017 and survived the swap
 events.
 We plotted the circulation and advertising rates for various groups.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From Figures 4 and 5, it appears that the increase in the mean rates in
 these affected markets could be attributed to survival bias.
 When we examine newspaper editions that were operational before 2017 and
 survived post-swap, we do not observe a significant rise in circulation
 and rates for editions owned by Postmedia and Metroland in the affected
 markets.
 On the contrary, the circulation and advertising rates for these editions
 are showing a slight decline post-event.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It appears that newspaper editions in the affected markets, not owned by
 Postmedia and Metroland, have managed to increase their rates and circulation
 following the event.
 This suggests a potential ability to fill the vacancy created in the lower-rate
 range by the closure of underperforming editions owned by Postmedia and
 Metroland.
 There are only 3 to 5 newspaper editions, representing a total of just
 28 observations, were operational before 2017, survived the events, and
 are managed by companies other than Postmedia and Metroland.
 The sample size for this specific subgroup is relatively small.
