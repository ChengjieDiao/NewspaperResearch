\begin_layout Title
Factors Influencing the Circulation Patterns of Canadian Community Newspapers:
 An Empirical Study
\end_layout

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite the extensive attention given to daily newspapers due to their comprehen
sive coverage of national and international news, there exists a significant
 research gap when it comes to community newspapers in Canada.
 There is a severe lack of academic papers discussing community newspapers
 in Canada.
 However, these local publications hold a critical role in delivering informatio
n that is regionally relevant, serving as essential channels for local governmen
t activities, advertisements, and fundraising for local projects or elections.
 Moreover, they possess substantial cultural value as a cherished element
 of Canadian society.
 Furthur, community newspapers face challenges from online news platforms
 with declining profitability, which has led to closures of many newspapers.
 A noteworthy example is the that Postmedia and Toronto Star swapped dozens
 of community newspapers in 2014, with many of the swapped paper were shut
 down as a cost-cutting strategy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Newspapers have a longstanding tradition and appeal to older generations
 who may be less inclined to access news online.
 Additionally, community newspapers remain essential in areas with limited
 internet accessibility, ensuring that residents are not solely reliant
 on online sources.
 Hence, it is crucial to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the factors
 that affecting the circulation patterns of community newspapers since circulati
on serves as a direct measure of the reach of local news through these publicati
ons, knowing these factors will help policy makers to subsidize the companies
 or local regions more accurately with limited funds, and also serves as
 industrial research to help community newspapers to adjust their strategies
 to remain high level of circlulations under a shrinking market.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To address this research gap, this paper investigate factors influencing
 the circulation of Canadian community newspapers.
 specifically we explores the factors in the following categories:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ownership: This paper will examine whether newspapers with larger circulations,
 owned by large media companies, experience more significant declines compared
 to newspapers with smaller circulations, owned by small companies or family
 businesses.
 In addition, this study will examine whether local markets tend to exhibit
 higher concentrations over time, with large newspapers or newspapers owned
 by giant companies dominating circulation or these local markets favors
 small publishers, enabling them to maintain a significant share of circulation
 without being overshadowed by larger firms.
 The analysis will span the period from 2013 to 2019.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Competition: This paper will measure the competition level by the number
 of newspapers circulated in the same census subdivision and the number
 of newspapers circulated in the same census subdivision owned by other
 companies.
 It will investigate whether increased competition leads to a more substantial
 decline in circulation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Demographic Characteristics: This paper will analyze how factors such as
 population size, income levels, and average education levels correlate
 with circulation patterns.
 Understanding these demographic dynamics can provide insights into the
 target audience and readership preferences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By systematically exploring these factors, the research aims to provide
 a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing the circulation
 of Canadian community newspapers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To conduct our analysis, we acquired data from News Media Canada spanning
 the period from 2013 to 2019.
 This dataset provided valuable insights into free and paid circulations,
 newspaper ownership, names, and the markets in which they circulated.
 The circulation areas for each newspaper are consisted of addresses or
 names of specific locations such as cities, towns, streets, or local districts.
 However, the dataset did not provide a standardized market level required
 for further analysis.
 To address this issue, we utilized the geopy package in Python to obtain
 representative latitude and longitude coordinates based on the addresses
 or location names.
 We then mapped these coordinates to the corresponding census subdivisions
 in Canada.
 We defined a newspaper's market as the census subdivision in which it circulate
d.
 While this approach may have limitations, such as a newspaper may only
 circulate in certain streets rather than the entire census subdivision,
 we consider it a reasonable market definition.
 This is because most markets indicated in the dataset corresponded to towns
 or municipalities (census subdivisions).
 As a result, census subdivisions serve as the most suitable administrative
 districts for representing the circulation areas of community newspapers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For each census subdivision, we retrieved demographic characteristics from
 the CHASS data center.
 These characteristics included total population, growth rate, age distribution,
 education levels, and incomes, which have potential relevance to newspaper
 circulations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is important to note that the dataset provided by News Media Canada,
 while comprehensive, may be subject to noise and incompleteness.
 This is because newspapers have the choice to subscribe to membership with
 News Media Canada and voluntarily report their circulation statistics.
 Consequently, not all community newspapers across Canada are captured in
 this dataset.
 Furthermore, if a newspaper appeared in the dataset previously but is absent
 in the current year, it does not necessarily imply that the newspaper has
 ceased publication.
 It could be due to the newspaper suspending its membership or choosing
 not to report statistics to the association.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, our discussions with the data provider indicate that most influential
 newspapers opt to subscribe to News Media Canada as it is the leading associati
on for community newspapers.
 Membership offers valuable benefits such as low-cost webinars for editorial,
 marketing, and advertising departments, sales training, auditing, and represent
ation of members' interests in various public affairs issues.
 These services and resources are valuable to community newspapers and can
 potentially yield cost-cutting benefits.
 Consequently, we believe that this dataset adequately captures market features
 and can provide answers to our research questions.
